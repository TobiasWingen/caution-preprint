Our files are organized in different folders:

<b>Folder: Preregistration forms</b>

The folder “Preregistration forms” contains the preregistration forms submitted to the aspredicted.org platform prior to data collection.

<b>Folder: Materials</b>

The folder “Materials” contains the Qualtrics Survey exported from the Qualtrics Survey Platform using the “Print survey” function. For surveys conducted in Germany, we also provide an English translation of the central Material. Please note that the desciptions of the different research findings (Claims 1 to 5) are taken from Hoogeveen, S., Sarafoglou, A., & Wagenmakers, E. J. (2020). Laypeople Can Predict Which Social-Science Studies Will Be Replicated Successfully. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 3(3), 267-285. and need to be cited accordingly.

<b>Folder: Data and Analyses</b>

The folder “Data and Analyses” contains our prepared data sets that were used for our analyses. It moreover contains all analyses scripts for the statistical software R, that can be used to reproduce our results. Finally, it also includes the R output of our analyses as HTML documents. To reproduce our results, you can either examine these HTML documents, or you can run the analyses yourself using R. To run the analyses yourself, we recommend using the prepared data files in .rda format, combined with the corresponding analyses scripts.
